# Thrones Engine
Thrones Engine is an Open-Source RESTful Webservice engine written in Spring and MyBatis frameworks. Without the need of building it from the scratch, the Thrones will help you develop your projects in a faster pace, for FREE.

Features:

An easy to use Unit Test API (No need for your Dao, Service and Controller tests calling the same annotations and doing the setups again and again)
One-click POJO and MyBatis Mapper Generator
Presetted Spring, MyBatis and Maven configurations (Just like I said, there is no need to set them up)
Presetted CORS configuration(To ease the problem regarding Cross-Platform setup)
A REST API client tester (No need to download any third-party RESTClient â€“ Note: Coming Soon!)
Well documented comments
An example demo is already included in the engine(Just make sure you run the DBDemo Scripts)
